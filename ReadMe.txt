This sales data analysis project is based upon a video by Keith Galli.

In this project we have sales data from an electronics store, that we are going to analyse to answer the following questions:

1. What was the best month for sales and how much money was earned that month?
2. What city had the highest amount of sales?
3. What time should we display advertisements in order to maximize the likelihood of the customer buying the product?
4. What products are most often sold together?
5. What products are sold the most and why?


The two phases of this project were the following:

1. Preparing the data:
    * Reading and merging of the monthly csv files into a single file containing all the data
    * Removing the NaN values from the data; performing basic cleaning operations.
    * Augmenting additional columns to the data, based on the requirements for the answering of the questions. 
    
2. Analysis: Using grouping and plotting methods to answer the questions.

There are 2 files that were used:
1. Analysis_rough: this is the file I used while following along with the youtube tutorial.
2. Analysis: this is the file I used to redo the project on my own, in a neater and more professional manner.
